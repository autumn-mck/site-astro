A couple weeks ago, the song "Trafik" by Joost and Kaarja was released

a few days later, I was sitting in trafic, and wanted to listen to some music - it started playing the song I'd previously been listening to, which was "Trafik"

this got me wondering, is there any way for me to automatically get Trafik to play when I'm in trafic?
