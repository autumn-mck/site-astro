# URL Understanding Tool

This project was created over the course of 10 weeks for my CSC1028 module, and although it is not a fully complete project, it provides a great framework for future work.

### Aims of the project

This project aims to be a tool for cybersecurity or power users to provide as much relevant metadata on a given URL as possible. Although there are only currently a few sources of data, the application is set up to be as easy as possible to add sources to.

The project has 3 main parts:

## HTTP APIs

[Code](https://github.com/autumn-mck/CSC1028APIs)  
The main component of this project is a set of HTTP APIs that can be queried for information on a URL/IP address to provide information from various sources, from local databases to external APIs.
The current data sources are:

- A local MongoDB database containing data from Project Sonar
- A local MongoDB database containing data on phishing/malware URLs from [Phishtank](https://phishtank.org/), [OpenPhish](https://openphish.com/), [URLHaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/) and [MalwareDiscoverer](https://malwarediscoverer.com/).
- Earliest page/hostname archive date, from <https://archive.org>.
- [Similarweb](https://www.similarweb.com/) global website rank
- IP Geolocation data (Currently from <https://ip-api.com/>, could probably be improved - this section did not have much thought put into it, and was mostly done as a proof of concept)
- [Stackshare](https://stackshare.io/) data

Several of these can also be queried via the command line, i.e. `node queryArchiveDate.js example.com`

For more information on dealing with Project Sonar's data, see [my how-to guide](/project-sonar/), but in summary, the data is stored in a local MongoDB database which, when full, can fill up to 60gb. We then use [text indexes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/index-text/) to allow _extremely_ performant queries to be made.

Note on Project Sonar's data:
6 days after I wrote my how-to guide, [Rapid7 switched to requiring you to apply](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2022/02/10/evolving-how-we-share-rapid7-research-data-2/) to access Project Sonar's data. Except now, a few weeks later, it no longer requires an account again, and this time I cannot find any blog post etc. mentioning this change back, so I do not know if this is a permanent or temporary change.
Update on 28/03/22: This appears to be a permanent change. See <https://opendata.rapid7.com/about/> to apply for access.

### Retrieving data

To retrieve the data used for the above HTTP APIs, some of the modules send a request to an external API, while some query a local MongoDB database. To fetch the data used to fill up the MongoDB database, there exists two programs: One for parsing and inserting Project Sonar's data, and one for fetching, parsing and inserting malware/phishing data.

### Creating the HTTP APIs

To create and manage the HTTP APIs, there is a single program (`createAllAPI.js`) that opens up all the APIs when run (Ports 10130 to 10135 by default). This program does almost nothing itself, and imports functionality from other modules to create the APIs (Notably `createHTTPServer.js`, which will take any function and open up an API for it on the given port.). This approach allows new APIs to be added with ease, and allows you to manage which modules are started.

### Running the application

For developing any of this project, you'll need a few things set up and installed. I'd recommend following the setup process I used in [my how-to guide](https://mck.is/project-sonar/#setup). You'll also want to install the dependencies listed in `package.json` with `npm install <package_name>`.
To actually get the data, you'll first want to run `./fetch/fetchMalwarePhishingData.js` and `./fetch/fetchMalwarePhishingData.js` (Assuming you've downloaded Project Sonar's data in a similar way as I did in my [how-to guide](https://mck.is/project-sonar/#parsing-a-local-copy-of-project-sonar)).  
You can then run `npm start` to start the APIs (This command then calls `node ./create/createAllAPI.js`, as specified in `package.json`).

### Testing plan

The easiest way to ensure the node.js APIs are working is to start the application by running `npm start` and querying them in your browser. For example, to query the archive date API, which is hosted on port 10133, you'd visit `http://localhost:10133/example.com` .  
![Example output from the API](./DebuggingAPI.png)

I've found that the best way to debug it is to make thorough use of `console.log(...);` to make sure I know the state of variables over time, which is extremely useful in helping to detect any issues.

### Further development

I've tried to make adding additional functionality to the API as easy as possible. All APIs are set up in the `createAllAPI.js` file, which itself contains very little code, and as a whole, the application is developed very modularly. As an example, we'll cover how querying similarweb works, as it has more requirements to get working than other functions. (You can view all the code for this [here](https://github.com/autumn-mck/CSC1028APIs/blob/master/query/querySimilarweb.js))

All query functions are stored in the `create` folder, and our function for querying similarweb is stored in `querySimilarweb.js`. At the top of the file, we begin by importing any other modules or functions we'll need.

```js
import "dotenv/config";
import getRemoteJSON from "./queryRemoteJSON.js";
import parseHostname from "../parse/parseHostname.js";
import createCli from "../create/createCli.js";
```

First of all, we're importing the `dotenv` module, as querying similarweb requires an API key, which we'll store in a `.env` file (More on that later). We're also using a couple of other functions that are defined in other files - `queryRemoteJSON.js` fetches JSON from a URL and `parseHostname.js` parses the string containing the URL into a URL object. `createCli.js` is used for allowing the function to be used via the command line (i.e. `node ./query/querySimilarweb.js example.com`), but this part of the application is just an optional extra that some of the functions provide, and isn't worth worrying much about.

Next up, we want to create the function that will actually be used to make the query. Since we're planning to use this function later on in a different file, we'll also need to export the function using `export default`. The function will also need to take in the URL that is being queried. We can then parse this into a URL object, which will allow us to select just the hostname, by using the `parseHostname` function we imported earlier. Then we build the string for the API that we're querying, and we can use the `getRemoteJSON` function we imported earlier to query the API, and we can return the result.

```js
let parsed = parseHostname(url);
// Construct the URL to query
const fetchUrl = `https://api.similarweb.com/v1/similar-rank/${parsed.hostname}/rank?api_key=${process.env.SIMILARWEB_KEY}`;

// Get the result of the query
let res = await Promise.resolve(getRemoteJSON(fetchUrl));

// If an error occurred, return -1, otherwise return the rank
if (res.meta.status === "Error") return -1;
else return res.similar_rank.rank;
```

Now, you might have noticed that nowhere in there are we creating our own queryable HTTP API or anything. So how does that happen?  
This is where the advantage of the application's modularity comes in. To see this in action, we can go back to the `createAllAPI.js` file.

Again, at the top of the file, we're importing all the functions we need from other files (notably `import createHttpServer from "./createHttpServer.js";` and `import fetchSimilarwebRank from "../query/querySimilarweb.js";`). Then, in our main function, we can call the `createHttpServer` function we've just imported, and we pass it the port we want it to use, and the function we want to use. In this case we're using port 10131 (Picked because it is not used by any major applications, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers>) and the `fetchSimilarwebRank` function. This `createHttpServer.js` allows us to add additional functionality on different ports with minimal effort, as it handles all of the networking side of the API, without this having to be re-architected for each additional function provided. You shouldn't even need to understand exactly what the `createHttpServer` function does to be able to use it, but if you do, the code is well commented.

### .env Files and API keys

Since I can't just share my API keys for anybody to use, the application makes use of a `.env` file to store these. This allows these secret values to be stored in a file that is not publicly exposed.

However, this means you will have to get your own API keys for the services that require them. Currently this is just similarweb and stackshare.  
For getting a free similarweb API key (5000 requests per month), [see here](https://support.similarweb.com/hc/en-us/articles/4414317910929-Website-DigitalRank-API#UUID-b25b8106-20c9-2d5a-e7b2-cdee63a4eaa6_section-idm4621956633339232800133052352)  
For getting a free stackshare API key (100 requests per month), [see here](https://www.stackshare.io/api)

Once you've got the API keys you want, you can then create a `.env` file, using the provided `.env.template` file as a template. The result should look something like:

```
SIMILARWEB_KEY=abc1234
STACKSHARE_KEY=abcd
```

## Electron App

![Electron app UI](./ElectronUI2.png)  
[Code](https://github.com/autumn-mck/CSC1028ElectronApp)

The electron app provides a user-friendly interface allowing the user to make queries regarding any URL, and displays the data to the user in a better format than the entirely raw JSON, however further steps should be taken as the current presentation is still not easily readable.

Since it is built with electron, the page is little more than a HTML page with some javascript behind it! As a result, all this app has to do is query the back-end HTTP APIs and display the result to the user!

### Running the application

Assuming you've followed the steps above for running/developing the central node.js app (Which you should have done, as this electron app isn't too useful without it), not much more is required to run the electron app. After opening the folder, you'll need to run `npm install --save-dev electron` to install everything required for electron. You can then run `npm start` to start the app.  
You might also want to look at <https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start/> for an introduction to Electron.

### Further development

The electron app itself is thankfully not too complex.  
First, there's the `main.js` file, which is a node.js application that is used to launch the electron browser window itself, which is `index.html`. This just works like a standard web page - the HTML is stored in `index.html`, the CSS in `index.css` (The CSS probably doesn't need to much editing - It's designed to work well with just plain HTML), and the javascript is in `renderer.js`.

The javascript doesn't have to do too much in this case - it only needs to query the Node.js APIs created earlier, and display the results to the user. If you're looking for something to improve in the electron application, I'd suggest this - currently, only the raw data returned is displayed to the user.

## Browser Addon

![Basic Addon UI](./BasicAddon.png)  
[Code](https://github.com/autumn-mck/CSC1028FFAddon)

The browser addon is extremely similar to the electron app, providing a user-friendly front end to the data, built with HTML and javascript. As it is integrated into the browser, it can automatically fetch and cache data as the user navigates the web.  
Note: The addon currently only supports Firefox, however it could be ported to support Chromium-based browsers extremely easily, as both share an extremely similar base API, with only a few functions being located in different namespaces, but providing the same results. (See [Chrome incompatibilities](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Chrome_incompatibilities) on MDN for details)

The addon's UI is also currently lacking as I chose to shift focus away from it, as I decided the Electron UI was more important initially. However, since both are based on HTML and javascript, and the Electron app was built upon the framework of the browser addon, the updates for the Electron app should be able to be ported without too much effort.

### Installing the addon

(Currently Firefox-only)  
Installing the addon is thankfully easy. Navigate to `about:debugging` and click on the "This Firefox" tab. Click on "Load Temporary Add-on..." and navigate to the folder containing the addon files. Click on any of the files (e.g. `manifest.json`) and load it. The addon is now loaded! Whenever you update your code and save it, you just need to click the "Reload" button that appears.

I'd also recommend looking at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) for excellent documentation of the WebExtension APIs.

![Loading the addon](./LoadingAddon.png)

### Further development

The browser addon is similar in concept to the electron application, except with the front-end for displaying data being decoupled from the backend for requesting data.

The backend is stored in `backround.js`, which as the name suggests, runs in the background. It uses event listeners to tell when the user changes to a different tab/web page, and if the data for that page has not been requested, request it and cache it by storing it in the addon storage.

The front-end is in `popup/urlInfo.html` (This, and the background script file, are determined in `manifest.json`.), which provides a UI similar to the electron app whenever the user clicks on the toolbar button, which queries the cache and displays the data for the user's current tab.

## Improvements and vision

The project in its current state is nowhere near complete, but serves as a foundation to build further upon.

There are many possible new data sources that could be integrated into the project, for example:

- Crowdsourced datasets, eg Trustpilot and other user-driven sources of metadata
- What tech stack companies are using, and alert the user to suspicious activity if a different result is actually found, using information from <https://stackshare.io>
- Further integration with archives, e.g. thumbnails of pages from the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) - If a webpage has only existed for a few days its chance of being malware or a phishing attack are higher
- Data from [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) to find sites that point to a given page (They were having [issues with 503 errors](https://groups.google.com/g/common-crawl/c/kEHzXZNu5To) when I last looked into integrating this, although it appears to have been fixed since.)
- Possibly other sources of data like Mozilla Observatory or Google Lighthouse.
- Add an extension page to the browser addon providing functionality similar to the electron app, allowing the user to query any URL
- General improvements to the user experience.

And many other possible sources of interesting metadata!
