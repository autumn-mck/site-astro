Hiya! I'm Autumn, a trans woman currently living in Northern Ireland. This blog post, bordering on essay, is half guide to navigating the system as-is, and half condemnation of it, plus a bit extra at the end. It's primarily focused on Northern Ireland, not just because I live here, but also because when searching online for information about the healthcare system for trans people in the UK, NI is usually either barely mentioned, or just completely forgotten about.

If you haven't seen the video titled ["I Emailed My Doctor 133 Times: The Crisis In the British Healthcare System"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1eWIshUzr8), by Abigail Thorn, I strongly recommend it. She's funnier than I am, and my conclusions are inspired by hers.

## The system

The way the system is currently set up in the UK, to get your gender legally recognised (assuming your gender identity happens to fall neatly into the binary deemed acceptable by the UK government), you must send an application to the government's "Gender Recognition Panel", who decide if you "trans enough" (not an actual quote) to be legally recognised as your own gender. They apparently <q cite="https://www.gov.uk/apply-gender-recognition-certificate">look at your application within 22 weeks of applying</q>. How it takes them almost 6 months to read a few letters, I have no idea.

As part of this application, you are required to have two reports from medical doctors and/or a clinical psychologist, which according to the UK government's website, <q cite="https://www.gov.uk/apply-gender-recognition-certificate/what-documents-you-need">you’ll probably need to pay for them even if you use NHS medical practitioners.</q> Plus paying £5 for the application itself. It's a wonderful healthcare system we have here.

One of these reports must confirm your diagnosis of "gender dysphoria", a definitely real diagnosis that is always 100% of the time absolutely applicaple. To get this diagnosis, you must either:

**a.** attempt to navigate the NHS system by getting referred to a Gender Identity Clinic/Gender Dysphoria Clinic by your GP, and get a gender dysphoria diagnosis there  
**b.** if you can afford to pay, sign up to one of several private clinics - all online, since none exist in Northern Ireland

As an example for how expensive private is, one clinic charges: £195 for a "set-up fee", £30 every month for a "monthly membership", £65 for a consultation to create your "transition pack", then £185 for the 45 minute "formal diagnosis session", for a minimum of £475. That doesn't even include hormones, blood tests, etc, which I've heard from a friend costs an extra ~£40 per month on average.

As for the NHS, there is a single clinic to cover all of Northern Ireland - the Brackenburn Gender Identity Clinic in Belfast.

## My experience (so far)

A couple of years after I realised I was trans, I began attempting to take the NHS pathway. When going to my GP to ask to be referred, I was able to cite the Royal College of GPs' guidance on ["The role of the GP in transgender care"](https://www.rcgp.org.uk/representing-you/policy-areas/transgender-care), which they say is "to promptly refer, where appropriate, to a Gender Identity Clinic". (As in, not refuse, or introduce arbitrary delays, which I have heard from others attempting to do the same).

Thankfully in my case, my GP listened to me, and within a few weeks I received a letter from the Brackenburn clinic (despite the NHS having my email address), asking me to email or phone them to confirm that I did actually wish to opt into the service - an unnecessary step which only serves to add further delays, with the risk of people missing the letter and not added to the waiting list, therefore being forgotten about. A week later, I received another two seperate letters from the Brackenburn clinic to confirm I had been added to the waiting list, and say they are "unable to provide ... a timeframe regarding an initial appointment".

In an <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> that has [since been removed](https://web.archive.org/web/20191217023650/https://belfasttrust.hscni.net/pdf/BrackenburnClinic-FAQ.pdf) from their website, Brackenburn state they "endeavour to see people for their first appointment within the set target of 13 weeks". At time of writing, I have been waiting for 52 weeks.

## The bit the title spoils

Despite being told "we are no longer giving out waiting list position numbers", I can still make a guess. Last month, I made an <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FoI</abbr> request to the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. After taking longer than the twenty working days they <q cite="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/section/10">must</q> respond within, I received the [latest numbers as of the end of 2024](https://belfasttrust.hscni.net/download/720/march/21673/33142-brackenburn-gender-identity-clinic-waiting-times.pdf).

As of the start of March 2025, there are currently 1,083 people currently on the waiting list. In 2024, only 13 people on this list were seen for initial appointments. This isn't lower than normal, in 2023 there were also only 13 people seen for initial appointments. At this current rate, anybody joining the waiting list can currently expect to wait **_over 83 years for an initial appointment_**. You won't have to wait this long though - many people in front of you in the waiting list will die of old age, or otherwise, before they ever receive their initial appointments.

It looks like I'll have to wait until my 80th birthday before my initial appointment.

Also shockingly, **_not a single person under the age of 18 was seen for an initial appointment in 2024_**, through the "Knowing Our Identity" service. As bad as the system is for adults, it functionally does not exist for under-18s who wish to be referred.

## What does it mean?

<q cite="https://doi.org/10.1108%2F03684920210417283">The purpose of a system is what it does</q>, the outcomes it produces - there is <q cite="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminkomlos/2021/09/13/the-purpose-of-a-system-is-what-it-does-not-what-it-claims-to-do/">no point in claiming that the purpose of a system is to do what it constantly fails to do</q>.

Throughout this process, every person I have dealt with has been polite and understanding. I'm sure many of them see themselves as allies. Yet, the purpose of a system is what it does. And what this system does is suck hope from people who need it most, leave them alone and isolated, and treat them as "other" for simply the possibility of them being trans.

The system, as it is, does not want trans people to exist in Northern Ireland, unless you can afford to pay for private healthcare. If a waiting list is so long that you cannot expect to ever receive an appointment within your lifetime, the only thing it provides is a misdirected sense of hope.

It doesn't need to be this way. I am far from alone in saying the UK needs to get rid of the system as it is, remove the waiting lists and requirements to be trans enough by somebody else's standards, and move to an informed consent model similar to other countries.

## What I'm currently doing

I've attempted to contact my local MLAs with the following email, although I'm not expecting much to come out of that alone. (Did you know you can contact your local MLAs about transferred matters, including health? You can see who represents you using [TheyWorkForYou](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/), and see their phone numbers or email addresses on the [Northern Ireland Assembly](https://aims.niassembly.gov.uk/mlas/emails.aspx) website!)

<section>

Dear (name),

I am writing to you as one of your constituents to bring to your attention the appalling waiting times for the NHS' Brackenburn Gender Identity clinic, the only one in Northern Ireland providing assessment for and support of transgender people.

Per a recent FoI request [1], there are 1,083 people, including me, currently on the waiting list for an initial appointment, with only 13 initial appointments being given per year. At this current rate, it will take 83 years for anybody currently being referred to receive an initial appointment.

Given that everybody on this waiting list must be 17.5 or older, anybody currently joining the waiting list can expect to be dead before ever receiving an initial appointment.

How is this in any way acceptable, and what is your plan to address this specific issue?

Yours sincerely,
Autumn McKee

So far I've received 2 responses - I plan to update this to go into more detail later.

## What now?

We continue to fight, as we always have.

We don't need somebody else's approval to exist.

Be kind, and support each other.
