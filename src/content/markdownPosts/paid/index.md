A log of what I've been paid at anything resembling a job, to help anybody else compare to see if they're being paid equally and fairly.

[^1]: N/A here means they were part of the contract, I just didn't take them when I should have, and was paid to compensate
[^2]: 93 CHF per day (~£86) plus 584 CHF for travel, minus 330 CHF for travel costs
