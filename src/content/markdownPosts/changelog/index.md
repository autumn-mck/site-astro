# Changelog

Redesigning a site is fun! It gives me a chance to try out some new ideas, and see how the browser landscape has changed since I last looked.

(I've also just noticed that this reveals I've not changed the photo of myself since the very first version yet, whoops! I don't take photos of myself very often, but I've a couple interesting ideas for what would make a good new one)

Here's how this site has changed over time:

## v2 - Astro - 2024

![Version two's index page - A "Terminal" displaying some information about me on the left, a short "About" section on the right, and a header covering the width of the page. The background is a photo of a forest during Autumn](./v2-index.png)

![Version two's blog page - A grid of blog posts grouped by year, each with a preview image. The background is a photo of a forest during Autumn](./v2-blog.png)

The current version! Hopefully it lasts for at least a couple of years.

## v1 - WebGenJava - 2022-2023

![Version one's index page - A "Terminal" displaying some information about me on the left, a short "About" section on the right, and a small header in the middle at the top. The background is a photo of a field at sunset](./v1-index.png)

![Version one's blog page - It's styled very simply, with a plain dark background, the header raised slightly](./v1-blog.png)

I wrote a custom static site generator from scratch to translate markdown into HTML, and build a website out of it. A terrible idea that I had a lot of fun doing anyway!

Every page but the index page used a custom version of [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/), a great stylesheet for semantic HTML.

## v0 - handwritten - 2021ish

![Version zero's index page - A photo of me on the left along with some links to social medias, and an extremely long wall of text on the right about me. The background is a photo of a field at sunset](./v0-index.png)

I don't know why I thought trying to cram so much text on the right was a good idea?  
Gradually grew over time to become v1. For the most part I prefer how v1 looks, although I do quite like how I styled the h-card on the left.
